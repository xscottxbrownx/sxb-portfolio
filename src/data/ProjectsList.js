    "I've used this discord bot since February 2022. It was clear their team needed much help with customer support and the documentation on the bot was lacking. I took it upon myself to help their users in the Tickets bot Support discord server. Tickets bot team ultimately saw the value I provided and offered me a spot on their official support team.  Shortly after, I convinced them to allow me to completely re-write the documentation to explain all features, settings, and possible configuration options - as it was obviously needed.",
